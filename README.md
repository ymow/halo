For each phone call, this android application will help you record video automation.

So we can review what kind of background with phone call conversation, and when

hand up the phone call, video recording service will stop automation and display the video in APP.

If someone caller and answer both install halo application,  they can compare the same 

voice conversation with different scenario (this part still not implement)
